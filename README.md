## Me

Currently, I live in New Hampshire's Lake region (shown above). I was born in Harrisburg, Pa, but I tell people I am from [Hershey](https://www.hersheypa.com/). For some reason, more people know about chocolate than the capital of a state.  I left home to join the Navy after graduating from high school.  In the Navy, I volunteered for submarine duty. (Side note: I volunteered to serve on ships designed to sink. Please do not expect me to be to normal.)  During my time in the Navy, I was married to a great woman and had four children. After about 20 years in the Navy, I had to get a real job. My children have since blessed me with four grandchildren.  

## Data

The concept of turing data into useful information is something I find interesting. As such since about 1985, I have been discovering really interesting things for sometime. I will not bore you with the details associated with years of projects and discovery. If you are interested in that type of information you can check out [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/glenndlehman/).

## Organizations

I have belonged to lots over the years. Currently I am active with [Boston Python](https://about.bostonpython.com/).
